## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Create a New Feature

```bash
You: "Add user authentication to my Angular app"

AI: [Activates Superpowers Brainstorming]
    "Let me understand your authentication needs:
    1. What authentication methods?
    2. Any social logins needed?
    3. Role-based permissions?
    4. Compliance requirements?
    5. Session management?"

You: "Email/password with JWT, role-based access"

AI: [Selects Angular Patterns + TDD Workflow skills]
    "Perfect! I'll create:
    - Auth service (login, logout, token refresh)
    - Route guards (protected routes)
    - JWT interceptor (attach tokens to API calls)
    - Role-based directives (UI access control)
    - Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
    - E2E tests (Playwright)"
```

### Use Case 2: Debug an Issue

```bash
You: "The MQTT connection is dropping frequently"

AI: [Activates IoT Knowledge Base]
    "Based on IoT platform architecture:
    - Check MQTT broker logs
    - Verify QoS levels (telemetry uses QoS 0)
    - Check iot-application service health
    - Review InfluxDB write performance

    Common causes:
    1. High message throughput → Buffer full
    2. Network instability → Increase keepalive
    3. InfluxDB slow writes → Check batch size"
```

### Use Case 3: Generate Documentation

```bash
You: "Create a PRD for the new mobile app in Notion"

AI: [Activates Notion MCP + Superpowers Brainstorming]
    "I'll create a PRD in Notion with:
    - Feature overview
    - User stories
    - Technical requirements
    - API endpoints
    - UI mockups (from Figma)
    - Success metrics

    [Creates page in Notion]
    ✅ PRD created: https://notion.so/prd-mobile-app"
```

### Use Case 4: Code Review

```bash
You: "Review this PR for the new API endpoint"

AI: [Activates Backend Knowledge Base + Code Review skill]
    "Checking against jt-api-v2 patterns:
    ✅ Controller layer present
    ✅ Service layer present
    ✅ Repository layer present
    ✅ DTO transformation correct
    ❌ Missing error handling for InfluxDB timeout

    Here's the fix:
    [Generates code following jt-api-v2 patterns]"
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After installation, verify:

- [ ] Skills installed: `ls ~/.claude/skills/`
- [ ] Knowledge bases loaded: Ask AI "What do you know about DeJoule?"
- [ ] Superpowers active: Ask any question, AI should brainstorm first
- [ ] MCP servers configured: `cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep mcpServers`
- [ ] Tokens set: `cat ~/.claude/.env`
- [ ] AI assistant restarted

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Skills not loading

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify skills are installed
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# Restart AI assistant completely

# Test with simple question
"What skills do you have available?"
```

### Issue: MCP servers not working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify tokens are set
cat ~/.claude/.env

# Test connections
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user

# Check Claude settings
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 mcpServers

# Restart AI assistant
```

### Issue: AI not using knowledge base

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ask AI to activate knowledge base
"Activate DeJoule Knowledge Base"

# Verify knowledge base files exist
ls ~/.claude/skills/dejoule-knowledge-base/

# Check knowledge graph
cat ~/.claude/skills/dejoule-knowledge-base/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.json
```
